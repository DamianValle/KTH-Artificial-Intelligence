# This file describes some constants which stay the same in every testing environment

# Total number of fish
N_FISH = 70

# Total number of fish species
N_SPECIES = 7

# Total number of time steps per environment
N_STEPS = 180

# Number of possible emissions, i.e. fish movements 
# (all emissions are represented with integers from 0 to this constant (exclusive))
N_EMISSIONS = 8

# Time limit per each guess (in seconds)
# You can change this value locally, but it will be fixed to 5 on Kattis
STEP_TIME_THRESHOLD = 5
